# Copilot Instructions

- Always run tests
- Always use Mocha for testing (added as a devDependency and invoked via `npm test` or `just test`)

If the user suggests any additional tools, conventions or new learnings during a conversation, suggest adding this as a rule to this `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file.
